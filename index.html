  <h1>🚗 Reinstatement vs. Redemption Cheat Sheet</h1>

  <div class="card">
    <p>This cheat sheet helps Auto Collections Associates determine the correct resolution path based on loan status, sale status, and state‑specific rules.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h2>📘 Reinstatement (Pre‑Charge‑Off)</h2>
    <p>“Because your loan hasn’t charged off and we’re before the <span class="highlight">Legal‑to‑Sell</span> date on your Notice of Intent to Sell, you can <span class="highlight">reinstate</span> by paying your past‑due amount plus applicable repossession‑related fees. Reinstatement brings the account back into good standing and stops repossession activity.”</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h2>📕 Redemption (Post‑Charge‑Off)</h2>
    <p>“Because the loan has charged off, to get the vehicle back you must <span class="highlight">redeem</span> by paying the <strong>full loan balance</strong> (including any allowed interest, fees, and repo‑related costs) before the vehicle is sold. Redemption is available until the car is actually sold at auction.”</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h2>⚡ Fast Eligibility Check</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="emoji">📉</span> <strong>Charge‑off status?</strong><br>
        Not charged off → Reinstatement path may be available.<br>
        Charged off → Redemption path.
      </li>
      <li><span class="emoji">📆</span> <strong>Legal‑to‑Sell (LTS) date still open?</strong><br>
        Reinstatement allowed only until LTS (per NOI to Sell).
      </li>
      <li><span class="emoji">🔍</span> <strong>Sale status?</strong><br>
        Redemption allowed until vehicle is sold.
      </li>
      <li><span class="emoji">📜</span> <strong>State exception needed?</strong><br>
        Some states allow reinstatement even after charge‑off. Check the state matrix first.
      </li>
    </ul>

  <div class="card">
    <h2>🛣️ Path Scenario Scripting</h2>
    <h3 class="section-title">✅ Reinstatement Path (Pre‑Charge‑Off; LTS not expired)</h3>
    <p>“Good news—because your loan hasn’t charged off and we’re still before the Legal‑to‑Sell date on your notice, you can reinstate by paying the full past due balance plus fees.”</p>

    <h3 class="section-title">🔁 Redemption Path (Post‑Charge‑Off; Until Sale)</h3>
    <p>“Because the account has charged off, the way to get the vehicle back is redemption—paying the full loan balance including any allowed interest, fees, and repossession costs. Redemption is available until the vehicle is sold at auction.”</p>

    <h3 class="section-title">⚖️ State‑Required Reinstatement After Charge‑Off</h3>
    <div class="state-list-box">
      <div class="state-list-title">States that permit reinstatement even after charge‑off:</div>
      <div class="state-names">
        California · Illinois · Maryland · Mississippi · New York · Ohio · Pennsylvania · Rhode Island · Washington DC · Wisconsin
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>“In your state, the law allows a borrower to reinstate even after a charge‑off under certain conditions. That means we can reverse the charge‑off solely to process a reinstatement, as long as we’re before the Legal‑to‑Sell date and you pay the past‑due amount plus applicable repossession fees.”</p>
  </div>

    <h2>🧭 Quick Decision Guide (for the Agent)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="emoji">❓</span> <strong>Has the loan charged off?</strong><br>
        No → Reinstatement may be available until LTS.<br>
        Yes → Redemption only, unless state requires post‑CO reinstatement.
      </li>
      <li><span class="emoji">🚗</span> <strong>Has the vehicle sold?</strong><br>
        No → Redemption still possible (post‑CO) / Reinstatement still possible (pre‑CO + before LTS).<br>
        Yes → Neither reinstatement nor redemption is available; proceed with deficiency/closure workflow per policy.
